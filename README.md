Blockchain can be used in developing many real life application that can solve the issue of trustability. Voting system is one of them. We all know a fair Voting System is an important part on a Democratic Country. Hence in this project we have tried to implement a simple voting solution using Blockchain technology.
Some points which I have considered while developin the contract are- 
1- Develop a complete dapp for voting system. Smart contract should be hosted on the ethereum testnet.
2- Admin can register the candidates in the smart contract before election.
3- Where voter has to first get itself whitelisted on the smart contract from the admin.
4- Admin can only start and stop voting.
5- Voters should be able to vote only when voting is started.
6- Admins should not be able to vote.
